## Get started

Install the dependencies by `npm i`,
then start either the first simple exmaple by `npm run example-1`,
the second more advanced example by `npm run example-2` or even
(the best and most advanced ðŸ˜„) example by `npm run gh-pages`, which runs both
the simple and advanced exmaples in a simulated browser.

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the example running.
Feel free to play with the code!

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in `package.json` to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
